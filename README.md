# Eat the Burger

![burger image](1.gif)

### This is my very first full stack project. I can say this is an app, but really, not has too much functions. The main purpose for this project is know how from and back end talk to each other and how to organize all files so it can be more orgnaize for frontend and backend folders.

### First is I need to have my database and then build the connection between frontend and back end using orm.
